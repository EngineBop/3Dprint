## Basic Considerations When Slicing an STL File

- **Layer Height:** Determines print resolution and speed; lower values give finer detail.
- **Infill Density:** Controls internal structure strength; higher infill means stronger but slower prints.
- **Supports:** Needed for overhangs or complex geometries; enable if your model has unsupported areas.
- **Print Speed:** Affects quality and time; slower speeds usually improve print quality.
- **Shells/Perimeters:** More shells increase strength and surface quality.
- **Material Settings:** Set correct temperature and cooling for your filament type.
- **Bed Adhesion:** Use options like rafts or brims if the model has a small contact area with the bed.

Adjust these parameters based on your model and printer for optimal results.
